    as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions, and geopolitical events. For Your safety when using any navigation features, always pay

    <b>5. Third Party Materials</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b></b>
</p>
<p>
    The Software may display, include, link or otherwise make available to You Content, data, information, applications, software, materials or websites of
    third parties (“<b>Third Party Materials</b>”). You acknowledge and agree that Your use of Third Party Materials may be subject to the terms of one or more
    third party license agreements, terms of use or the like, and You agree to comply with all such terms. To the extent that the Software is packaged or

    locations: (1) this Agreement (including, without limitation, the body of this Agreement, or as an attachment, appendix, exhibit, or the like, hereto), (2)
    the “About” section of the Qualcomm Toq software application(s) You have received (3) posted by QCE on its website, (4) in the packaging or materials
    provided for or with Your device, or (5) made available separately by third parties in conjunction with Your use of the Software.
</p>
<p>
    <b>6. Privacy</b>
</p>
<p>
    QCE does not collect Your personal information unless you contact us to purchase a product, service, or to request customer support in which case our
    website privacy policy is applicable and can be found at <a href="http://toq.qualcomm.com/privacy-policy">http://toq.qualcomm.com/privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When You first turn on your device, Your contact information will be transmitted via Bluetooth from Your handset to the smartwatch but not to QCE.
</p>
<p>
    While using the smartwatch, the Application will transmit call, text, and other applicable data via Bluetooth to Your smartwatch depending on the services You use.  We will also collect anonymous usage logs regarding the features and functions of the smartwatch that You use.  This information does not identify You and helps us improve the smartwatch and our products and services. If You don’t want us to collect anonymous usage logs, visit the "about" screen in the Toq app and un-check the box. 
</p>
<p>
    The smartwatch enables selected third parties to offer services such as “voice-to-text,” weather reports, stock tickers, and other functions. The
    Application may provide information to such third parties to enable these services. For example, the Application provides the current location of the
    smartwatch to Accuweather.com (but not Your name nor any device unique identifier) in order to display weather reports. Accuweather.com’s use of location
information is subject to their privacy policy which may be found at    <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/en/privacy">http://www.accuweather.com/en/privacy</a>. In addition, the smartwatch collects your speech and certain
    profile data from your device through a “voice-to-text” service, which speech and data is then sent by the Application to Nuance Communications, Inc. to
    enable that service. Nuance’s use of Your speech and data is subject to Nuance’s privacy policy which may be found at
    <a href="http://www.nuance.com/company/company-overview/company-policies/privacy-policies/index.htm">
        http://www.nuance.com/company/company-overview/company-policies/privacy-policies/index.htm
    </a>
    . QCE does not receive information from the Application or smartwatch to enable these third party services.  We may receive certain usage data from our third party service providers and, in addition, collect anonymous usage logs from the Application as described above.  The usage date and logs we collect are anonymous and do not identify any particular person.
</p>
<p>
    Additional terms of use, disclosures and consents specific to Your use of services from E*Trade and “voice-to-text” services on the smartwatch are included in Attachment A to
    this Agreement.
